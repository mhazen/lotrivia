Host trivia games in The Lord Of The Rings Online with this Lua plugin.

This project was started for two purposes: fun, and to put together a project in Lua, which I had used (briefly) years before.

It's a trivia hosting plug-in for a popular MMO based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, inspired by the tedium of hosting such trivia games online.

There's an existing page on the LOTRO Plugins respository, located here:

Have fun!
