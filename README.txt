LOTRivia: A Plugin for Lord of the Rings Online
Written by Carentil of Windfola (lotrocare@gmail.com)

version 1.0 README

What It Does:
LOTRivia lets you host an in-chat trivia game, while playing Lord of the Rings Online.
It takes care of the tedious bits of typing in or pastin in questions, coloring the
text to make it stand out, typing in "so-and-so got it!" and keeping track of scores,
and pretty much anything else I could automate.

What it has:
    - A library of over 850 trivia questions and riddles covering Tolkien's
      writing, books and movies based on his works, and Lord of the Rings Online.
      It's pretty easy to extend the list of questions, as well.
    - Pretty colors and formatting, to catch players' eyes.
    - Built-in help

How to install it:
Drag the "Carentil" folder into your 'Plugins" folder. For Windows
users, that's going to be in the "Lord of the Rings Online" directory, under "My Documents".
Once you've put it in place, you can log in to LOTRO, and either type "/plugins load lotrivia"
or you can just use the plugins manager to load the plug in.

The plugin's windows will appear, along with a little blue and purple question-mark button
that you can drag where you like, which will show/hide the windows as you like. You can
independently show or hide the Scores window with the "Scores" button, or adjust the settings
with the "Options" button.

To Play:
(Make sure you're configured to use the channel you like, click "Options" to choose).

1. Click the "Start Game" button. If you want, you may click "Send Rules" to tell the channel
what the rules of the game are. You will want to let people know you're starting a round of
trivia before you do this, of course.

2. A question will show up in the top (blue) panel. If you want to use that question, click
"Ask Question" and it will be sent to the channel. You can pick a different question with
"Skip Question", as many times as you like.

3. When a question has been asked, a timer will start to countdown. The first thing that people
in the channel say until the timer runs out or an answer is accepted will appear in the gray
scrollable window labeled "Current Guesses". If someone gets the answer right, click on their
answer, click "Accept Answer", and boom, their score goes up, it's announced to the channel, and
a new question gets picked for you to ask or skip.

4. If you want to edit a players' score (to award bonus points for a tough question, for example)
you can click their name in the Scores window, and adjust it as needed.

5. You can announce all of the scores to the channel by clicking the "Announce All" button in the
Scores window, or just the top three by clicking "Top 3".
